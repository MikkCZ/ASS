== Task introduction ==

- What should it do? -
In specified directory (and subdirs) find files with given name extension (*) and:
	copy them with another given extension or
	rename them - change their extension to another given or
	just remove them.
	
* in fact by extension is meant the file name (incl. file extension) ending

- And how it can be used? -
suffix_handle.sh [ -c | -m | -r ] ext1 ext2

-c for copy,
-m for rename and
-r for remove.
ext1 and ext2 are the desired extensions, where ext2 is not required by -r.

- What output can it produce? -
For copy and rename a list of files changed (before => after).
For remove a list of files removed.
And some error output... (nobody's perfect)

- Let's code it -
Check –v and –h parameters
Parse&check other params
	- read permissions for dir
	- operation param exists
	- extension params (parity)
Process the files

- Second argument -
Desired operation – just validate it.
	- operation param exists

- Third and maybe fourth arg -
Check arg number according the operation.
	- extension params (parity)

- Process the files (THIS IS IT) -
Finally make the desired operation.
	- IFS - file with space in their name
	- check read permissions for copy - protect from owners without read permissions ;-)

- 100 ! (feel like a champion) -
100 lines (incl. comments)
